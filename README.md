# SpaceStation Odyssey

*A zero-g time management sim made for CMPM/ARTG 120*

Here on humanity’s most advanced space station, the impact of everything you do is multiplied by hundreds compared to on Earth. Working out makes you that much stronger, studying makes you that much smarter, and each discovery made here improves the lives of that many more people. But, time is going by much faster, so 5 years will have passed on earth by the time you return. What you choose to fit in to your 42 hour stay is up to you. Just remember, you still need to take care of yourself while you’re up here.

## How to Play

Basic controls are simple! All you need is a mouse or touch.  
- Drag back to charge up and release to launch the astronaut in that direction.  
- Tap and hold to slow down.
- Go to a station to start an activity.
- Pay attention to your status meters and your remaining time!

## Experience Goals

The idea behind this game is to emulate the franitc, rushed experience of fitting many things in to a busy schedule. Between work, school, career aspirations and simply taking care of oneself, we all have to make difficult decisions all the time about how we spend our time. Often, we feel obligated to work to the point of exhaustion, only to be unable to do the things we really love or spend time with friends and family. Just like in the game, it is impossible to get it “right” the first time, so it is ok to make mistakes, or choose a different path later on. Luckily, we don’t have to decide how to spend 5 years worth of our time in 24 hours in real life.

## The Icing

We think this project stands out because of how work went into making the controls simple and intuitive. After Prof. Smith gave some pointers on how we could improve our controls, we put a lot of time into streamlining user input. We went from requiring both keyboard and mouse to mouse/touch only with optional keyboard controls. We also reworked the movement entirely so that players could click and drag anywhere on the screen to move the astronaut. We had to remake one of the minigames and modify the rest, but this control overhaul makes our game fully playable on mobile. 

We also put in a lot of work, including new asset creation, for our combined tutorial/title screen. Before players begin the game and the timer starts counting down, they are given a chance to get used to the controls and movement. They are also introduced to the core mechanic of interacting with "activity stations" through the tutorial activity. We feel that this is a very polished and intuitive way of teaching the player how to play.
